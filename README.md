# debian-minimal-gui

While using Qubes OS since a few years for my personal laptop, I was using Ubuntu and Xubuntu for my corporate laptop.
As I dislike some decision made by Ubuntu like the integration of flatpaks and because I want to controll more aspects of my linux installation and also keep it as minimal as possible, I have choosen to built my corporate laptop based on Debian minimal and setup the GUI myself using this as chance to look into wayland and also sway as tiling window manager.

This repository is mainly used for my own purpose to collect the notes during installation.

As a side note: I am running those configs on a the following older machines:

Thinkpad T490 
- 4 physical / 8 logical cores
- 8+32 = 40 GB RAM
- 1 TB NVME

DELL Precision 5520
- Intel Core i7-6820HQ CPU @ 2.70GHz with 4 physical / 8 logical cores
- 2x16 = 32 GB RAM
- 1 TB NVME

After boot and login into sway the systems needs ~700 RAM.
Without /home the current installtion costs ~3.5 GB storage.
